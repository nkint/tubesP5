# tubesP5 : procedurally drawing tubes over curves

TubesP5 is a [Processing](https://processing.org) library for drawing tube meshes over a collection of points (a line strip, or a curve).

It implements Parallel Transport Approach to Curve Framing, references could be found in paper from [Hui Ma,1995](ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/techreports/TR425.pdf) and in [Game Programming Gems volume 2](http://books.google.de/books?id=M2QYbTVd0VgC&lpg=PA215&ots=K4t0eyqKVS&dq=parallel+transport+frame+gems+2&pg=PA215&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).

It was a part (a little part, actually) of my project for Computational Geometry course at university with teacher A. Alzati
